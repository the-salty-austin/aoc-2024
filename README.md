# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar for programmers, where each day of December you are provided with a new problem to solve with a language of your choice. Each year has a fantastic plot and story line you can follow along with as you solve each days challenge.

Every day for 25 days this month you have programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree" and help the elves with their mission. Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills.

## ZTM Solutions Hub

We have created a special area for the ZTM community to share their solutions and code each day, see what others have done, and vote for your favourite solutions. We even have a leaderboard! This website was built by past ZTM students!

## How to participate:
In order to get started with Advent of Code, it is recommended that you watch the [Exercise: Santa's Node Helper](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/697434/lectures/12676702) and [Solution: Santas Node Helper](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/697434/lectures/12676701) lectures, where Andrei shows you how he goes about solving one of the problems from 2015 challenge. Even if you are not enrolled in the course, these two videos are free to preview to help you make the most of Advent of Code. 

Here's how to get started: 
1. Head on over to the [Official Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website, log in and open the puzzle for day one
2. Read through the puzzle requirements, write and test your solution in your chosen language. We recommend using Replit or Github to write, test and share you solution.
   - Remember to solve both parts of the days puzzle, ideally in the same repl to make it easier to share on the ZTM Solutions Hub
   - Don't use AI to solve the problem, You'll learn far more without AI
3. Once you have your solution url head on over to the [ZTM Solutions Hub](https://aoc.zerotomastery.io) and submit your solution. You can [follow this video on how to submit your solution](https://www.loom.com/share/7310b6e83bcc4922b25023b62d173611).
4. Check out the solutions board, compare your solution against other community solutions, learn different ways of achieving the goal and vote on your favourite solutions.
5. Get ready to solve the puzzle for each day of December ðŸŽ…

#### Things to note:
- Submitting solutions on the ZTM Solutions site will earn you extra points on the leaderboard!
- Even though the event starts on December 1st you can join at anypoint in December and post your solutions.
- You must always do the challenges in order. You won't be given day 2's puzzle without first completing day 1.
- Don't forget to complete the challenge without AI help.
